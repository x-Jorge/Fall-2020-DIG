                <div className="answer"> 🍃 Reduce the amount of times you drive.
                    Consider talking, taking public transportation,
                    carpooling or riding a bike to your destination.
                    This will reduce the amount of CO2 emitted and lessens traffic congestion.
                </div>
                <div className="answer"> 🍃 If you are driving, avoid making unnecesarry braking and acceleration.
                    Studies have found that aggressive driving can result in more fuel consumption
                    compared to consistent and calm driving.

                <h2 className="home-tips">Household</h2>
                <div className="answer"> 🍃 Consider using LED lightbulbs instead of the traditional ones. LED bulbs may cost
                    more
                    but they use a quarter of the energy of the incandescent ones and last up to 25 times longer.
                </div>
                <div className="answer"> 🍃 Make sure you turn off all electronic devices when not in use and dont forget to
                    turn off the light
                    when leaving your room.

                <div className="answer"> 🍃 Reduce the amount of food you waste by planning your meals ahead of time, freezing
                    any leftovers, and
                    reusing any leftovers that could be left behind.
                </div>
                <div className="answer"> 🍃 Consider eating more plant-based meals. Meat and dairy are responsible for 14.5
                    percent of manmade global
                    greenhouse gas emissions. You can reduce your carbon footprint by consuming more vegetables, fruits, and
                    grains.

                <div className="answer"> 🍃 If youre looking to purchase a new computer, try purchasing a laptop instead of a
                    traditional desktop.
                    Dekstops require more energy than laptops, making them less environmentally friendly.

                    Using cold water
                    instead of hot/warm water can also clean your clothes better.

                <div class="class"> 🍃 Buying secondhand clothes can save the resources used to otherwise create a new
